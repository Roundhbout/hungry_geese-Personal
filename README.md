# hungry_geese-Personal

This is a copy of my hungry_geese repo, which I no longer have access to the original since it was on a school github account that I no longer have access to. 

This project was for CS4100, Artificial Intelligence. 

We had a lot of flexibility in what to do for our final project, so I chose to participate in a kaggle competition to develop AI for a free-for-all snake game (Titled Hungry Geese).
We were given information regarding the board size, the location of all snakes (including our own) and the location of food, and were required to return a movement option
(one of the four cardinal directions) that would optimize our score in the game (getting the longest snake and staying alive the longest essentially).

While my code wouldn't win the tournament, I used the tournament as a chance to evaluate some search algorithms we had learned earlier in the class and see their performance against
other people's implementations.
